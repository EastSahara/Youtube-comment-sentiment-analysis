I hope you enjoy the views from the 78th floor penthouse. Let me know if you could live 78 floors up in the air with these views.
"you&#39;d have to be paying me the $39,500,000 to get me to live in such a dump"
if all of us in the comments pool our money together we can afford this place!
This video are what dreams are for even if one can never afford it.
I think it&#39;s depressing. So Pale
looks freezing cold and Jewish
Türk olduğunu video sonunda farkettim.
&quot;Amazing Views&quot;... if by amazing you mean run-down skyscrapers and a polluted river.
Stunning! I ❤ NY!
"The only problem i have with this is, i got a 3 room apartment with 1 room i never use. Just why would i want this?"
If you need something like this in your life I guarantee you this.<br>You do not deserve it.<br><br>There are thousands of homeless people while obnoxious pompous Rich materialistic pieces of garbage and have it masterpieces like this.
I bet it will never sell.
Maze Bank.
Impressing flat. A little scary because of vertigo i experience even in front of monitor. Nevertheless looking at NY&#39;s concrete is not worth so much.
"It&#39;s so cold and ugly, in my opinion. No thanks."
Looks lifeless and hollow. You couldn&#39;t pay me to live there. This is the result of low interest rates and the government printing and stealing trillions of dollars and wallstreet playing russian roulette with our savings.
"Beautiful views but too expensive, it seems like a house for a man.. The style is too minimalist and masculine details"
"&quot;Hey...lets film this property during a foggy,snowy day to highlight the fantastic view&quot;<br>idiots"
GTA 4 Penthouse
"This is really a great video, but as for me I make huge profits on my investment since I started trading with Mrs. Kathleen Jones, her trading strategies are topnotch"
She&#39;s looks like at my house .... really ..!! In the gta V
The countertops and backsplash did it for me. I will pass.
"Sure this is nice, but I prefer my studio apartment."
"nice, but i&#39;m looking to spend $40 mill."
"It feels so souless, empty"
"Im almost there, just $49. 495. 000 short"
"If owned by a CEO: &quot;OMG YOU DON&#39;T DESERVE THAT YOU ARE HOARDING ALL THE WEALTH!<br>If owned by a worthless actor, NBA player, socialist streamer: &quot;OMG GOOD JOB KING!&quot;"
I saw this being built back in 2012 &amp; 2013 when i had jobs in that area.
No worries about fires?
Ни хера себе
fa schifo questo appartamento
This place was awful for the money it costs. and it isn&#39;t the kind of place where you can go and just remodel everything...<br>i wouldnt want to live there even if i had the money to buy this. i&#39;ve seen much better for far less.
TE AMO DAME UN HIJO
Incredible views?? I most be living in the wrong time
Why would you stay at that high apartment to breath pollution?!?!?! Just why?
40m for this?<br>Someone is having a fucking blast. Ridiculous.
$39.500.000 house but still no bidet.
"Can I hang my laundry on the balcony? Other than that, it&#39;s fine."
"beautiful place but something feels a little off..... it feels like a bit soulless, or lonely or something"
"The cost of this is sickening, you would have to be an emotionless sub-human to spend this when there is so much suffering in the city"
And I really like...every second
"For the pull out drawers under the steps he says “remember, this is NY, every bit of space counts”. That’s something you say about cubby holes in a 400 sq ft studio apartment, this place has plenty of storage."
Balkon zur Nordseite geht gar nicht.
Can I pay in 4 installments ? Ac free ?
40mil and I can&#39;t get a back yard?? 😂😂
That&#39;s cheap!
I would not pay 1 dollar over 38 million for it.
"I like how it&#39;s not $40 million - it&#39;s like there&#39;s a $500,000 discount."
"Amazing views of smog, light pollution, concrete and a once great city utterly fucked by left wing politics. Rust in peace.<br>I have 500,000 square feet with 210 degrees of water and mountain views, the cleanest air you could pray for and almost zero light pollution. There is no dwelling yet but I paid nearly fuck all and it&#39;s already tripled in value. Tasmania 🧡. If President Trump bugged out, you know NYC is fucked."
the video is great but the camera man is so annoying. can&#39;t he just shut the hell up!
New York is overrated
Why everything looking narrow ?
"In addition, the overpricing of houses can render them inaccessible to poorly paid people"
You’d have to pay me that much just to move to a liberal hell hole like new york
"Looks like a perfect place for pompous jerkoff. $40 million gets one infinitely more if they were to choose to spend that money on a home in a much more beautiful part of the world as opposed to an immensely ugly and despicable city like NYC. Given that one isn&#39;t allowed to go anywhere or do anything in NYC, I feel like this place should $0. Anyone who would get this place is an absolute jerkoff and there is no doubt about it!"
40 millones y me parece súper feo el diseño del ático. Pero las vistas muy bonitas.
bu evlere sanirim sadece shifting ile sahip olabilicem😭
I HAVE BEEN MAKING LOSSES TRADING MYSELF...I THOUGHT TRADING ON DEMO ACCOUNT IS JUST LIKE TRADING THE REAL MARKET... CAN ANYONE HELP ME OUT OR AT LEAST ADVICE ME ON WHAT TO DO?
"But its still a view of concrete, asphalt, and assholes as far as the eye can see! if that is your idea of a great view... well, go for it and I hope you are happy.. I wouldn&#39;t give ya 5 bucks for it."
And what makes it worth 40.000.000? I bet you could make a similar apartment for 1.000.000
"Just a normal day, watching things I can’t afford, on my friend’s free Wi-Fi"
The 40 million penthouse for the person who loves to sit around tables.
Shot for every time they say &quot;views&quot; or &quot;incredible&quot;
May I have your $1M to live my life forever.
Чтобы жить в такой квартире нужно чтобы несколько сотен людей были на дне
I don&#39;t like skyscrapers. I would rather live in a two story bungalow with a front yard.
I find it interesting that people would pay 39million to live in a fancy concrete prison shared with other inmates.
No comments. 40M for a penthouse in a city. That’s ridiculous
Looks like you have a wonderful view of the pollution
"I got 100 dollars and 100 pesos, can I fiance the rest. 20.00 a week? Lol"
I was wandering what will be Maintenance charges per month 😅
40mil and not even washlets are an option LOL
Fucking Amazing!
Дёшево и не практично. А вот стоимость на тупого потребителя
You can stay in any 5 star hotel in the world 🌎 just from the profit of saving that penthouse cost in the bank.
When he is rounding up half a million
Wouldn&#39;t pay 1000 dollars a month for it.. Being high up and nowhere near local shops or able to walk. And things like fires and other hazards.. Would feel trapped.. No chance
The most im paying is 2 million
I feel like you’d get a badass mansion and a ridiculous amount of land in a lot of other states for a lot less than 40 mil
Enes abi evlere dekor evcil hayvan lazımsa bana ulaşabilirsin
Could never live here tho. No trees no garden😅
Terrible kitchen design. No eye for color or innovation.
"the money it cost to purchase this for 1 family would help house more than 400 families have a place to call home. That is how bad the deficit is and the people that spend on such things. dont even consider that. Also &quot;powder room&quot; get a grip you pretentious douche toilet or water closet, say it."
Pigeons living freely WTF 😒
If I that was mine I swear I will never leave the house for anything
scam lol
"If i had that i would have no real friends, my mates would see it once then think im a posh nob. <br>Must be lonely at the top but willing to try lol. <br>Also, im a tradesman and noticed a few defects just from the video so im guessing whom built it dont wear it. I will offer $500 today, cash? Please."
Not a very good vieuw on this property.
I don’t think something this expensive can ever be a home. Surely it’s just an investment???
"I have a better high tech toilet than this house in my $1,000/month rent house.🚽🇯🇵 again, just a toilet."
Yeah but... It&#39;s in New York lol I ain&#39;t paying 35 million to have some bums pissing outside my building and a mayor who wants to tax me 50% of every dime I make. New York is like Hollywood... Dead.
No crypto punk included...? not worth it...
wat een kk huis<br>wel een leuke man
"Не обижайтесь, но мне не очень понравилось. Как будто в офисе живут."
Not worth it. Who wants a view of a cesspool??
Such penthouse represent the top of our civilization. But then again... why is it for sale?
7평 원룸에서 보고있는데 현타 오네..
"it&#39;s a total rip off for the way too rich. Any larger flat can be renoved to look as luxury from 1/20th of this price. Anyone who buys this pays $37,500,000 just for the view from the window.. I&#39;d rather buy a $4,000,000 castle or manor out in the woods/hills with fresh air, beautiful environment and large outdoor space."
"If would have 39 milions the last I would buy Is an apartment like this. Don&#39;t get me wrong it&#39;s a beutiful apartment, but 39 m for worth much more than the apartment."
No I’d get vertigo. Rather my shack on the lake with a few farm animals and fishing.
"I don&#39;t like those chairs, not for me."
Bill Burr is right we need to thin the herd out this shit didn&#39;t exist in the 40s being able to afford this is disgusting.
Totally not worth 40mil lmao
"$40 m in that dump of a city is the same as using money for a bon fire. The only thing nice about this is the inside. Step outside and you’ll be tripping over trash and feces. No thanks. You can get 10x that in any city but a blue one 🤷‍♂️🤪 when I saw views it looked like buildings covered with smog, thats not fog, grimey air."
Jebac biede!
End of Days....
"Very beautyfull but its also vulgaire, 40% of all humans live on less than a dollar per day. There are people in this world who can litterly end world hunger singel handedly by donating less than 2% of their wealth once. 🤔"
Obscene
Does it include parachutes?
"Sorry, my eyes don’t see 40 million dollars."
"Blah, where would I play with my dogs??"
This makes me realise more how broke I am 😑😊
sólo dire que i live in Latam
Tenpenny Tower
I couldn&#39;t be paid to live in NYC
Me: Meh <br>Also me: Broke af
"I don&#39;t like it at all! it doesn&#39;t have that cozy home look and feel, it looks more like a luxury hotel suite at least not for me even if I had the money for it."
I&#39;d only look out windows at night to keep from seeing the &quot;shithole&quot; that is NY these days.... it&#39;ll be on sale in a year after democrats run everyone out of town...
This must be Satan&#39;s place.
I have a better 💡... Buy a million dollar home and start a movement to help the homeless get back on their feet...<br>If all you rich sobs got together you could change the 🌎. <br>You make me sick.
Where tf do I get that kind of money ?
"Those are incredibly ugly views of a dirty city and shitty buildings. Not a tree, but there is a swamp river. For $40m not very nice either."
overlooking an overly polluted and congested garbage can. new york. oooh
跟迷宫一样，其实还是简洁点好，不过也这房子的景观真的很不错
At the end of the day those fancy stairs are still just stairs…😂 fancy toilets are still toilets and fancy furniture is still furniture. No “view is worth millions of dollars😂 go on a hike and enjoy a view. But I guess it doesn’t matter when your spending other people’s money with your businesses and passive income.
look like a friking Ikea catalogue. Who want to live in this???
Hope you enjoy that view as the rest of the city descends into chaos.
u pay 35 mio just for the view
it feels like a hotel not a home.
"Am I the only one here who thought this apartment is def not worth $40 mil? It was smaller than I thought, and I hated how segmented it was. You can find a house 2x as nice and for an 1/8th of the price on 5,000 acres of land"
They&#39;re afraid to mention the 100k a month maintenance fee. So add 1.2 million a year. And then the tax bill
40 million for that?? Only a complete idiot would buy that. Rooms are tiny. And NYC has become a crap hole. Conservatives are leaving. Liberals with money are leaving. The city has gone to the toilet.
"you can enjoy the amazing views of New York City! homeless men raping each other in broad daylight, heroine addicts doped and leaning in the middle of the street, violent muggers assaulting old women, hordes of looters running wild with stolen Gucci and sneakers"
"Esforçai-vos, e ele fortalecerá o vosso coração, vós todos que esperais no Senhor.<br>Salmos <a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=idJthveed1M&amp;t=31m24s"">31:24</a>"
Win the squid games and spend all the money on this apartment
Like a museum)
"<a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=idJthveed1M&amp;t=19m59s"">19:59</a> This clip is in reverse, and it makes me feel uncomfortable.<br>Also, while growing up, my dad taught me how to hold a flashlight. So if this place needs a lamp, I can totally do that job."
There is no single guest bedroom in the 40 million mansion very surprise
I hope it comes with a couple of maids. Keeping all the glass paneling clean is probably a full-time job. LOL
My Father&#39;s house is far more beautiful
акцент
Pretty cheap for the quality and location of the penthouse !😍😍
you could buy a whole building for that money....
"You literally could not pay to live that high up! Especially with children. 😩 <a href=""http://www.youtube.com/results?search_query=%23nothanks"">#NoThanks</a>"
spending all that just to live in an apartment
"Why would I sell my soul for that crap, when I go to heaven I&#39;ll have a bigger penthouse than that, JESUS CHRIST GOD IN FLESH NO RELIGION"
"So uhhh, how much would it cost to stay there for one night?"
"Damn, can&#39;t imagine if an emergency situation happens or a huge fire on the lower floors. 😳"
Imagine how many lives could be saved with that amount of money.
The view at night is amazing. Some of the bathrooms look nice. The rest of the place sucks. Perfect place for someone who only values possessions and prestige.
"Nice, spacious, luxurious but I don&#39;t see it as a home. Too isolated, too cold. No home warmth."
Beautiful wonderful ❤
Ehhh not warm and homey!
I wouldn&#39;t want to be up so high!
"👎🏾When your company doesn’t pay taxes, <br>and the government gives you money to blow why not 🤷🏾‍♀️"
The real price is $5M no more
And i can&#39;t even afford to Change up my bedspread at Ross
"Even if I had the money, this price is ridiculous; I know it&#39;s New York, but you can get something just as good as this in AZ or somewhere else for a fraction of the price."
I wouldn&#39;t pay $5 for that place to have to live in a shithole like NY
Sterile and bland. Yuck.
"Хотел купить, думал внутри он по больше. У меня дача больше"
"Was I the only one who got scared when I saw those windows had handles to open, but no sign of a screen. You could easily just fall right out!"
"Definitely not worth the money are you kidding, only a fool will by that"
"I can afford it, but the HOA makes it unaffordable, sorry."
It doesn&#39;t even look that nice . . . I don&#39;t get why anyone would want to live so dangerously high up. No thank you.
Are you from Bosnia or Albania?
"It’s ugly and cheap looking, How’s it worth that much, seriously"
"This is really nice, but I wouldn’t spend 40 million dollars for it. Get a real mansion with some privacy and nature to look at! 40 million for that tiny place? No way."
That&#39;s nice and military vets can&#39;t pay for the medical bills.
CHUMP CHANGE
Fun fact. Tony Stark actually passed on this place because he didn’t want to seem “poor” to the general public.
It&#39;s ridiculous. I wouldn&#39;t pay at all to live in a communistic shit hole.
I could imagine it&#39;s quite up there on the balcony other than the wind. But hearing the faint sounds of cars and horns out in the distance below you seems like a pretty amazing experience.
"You couldnt pay me to be stuck in New York city, i dont understand why people spend insane amounts of money to stare at ugly city skylines. Sprawling cities is one of mankinds biggest MISTAKES. Open country scenery is FAR more valuable. I would sooner live in a carboard box, somewhere in the mountains of Pennsylvania or West Virginia, with FRESH AIR and actual scenery (mother nature ALWAYS beats man made) than be stuck in some New York city apartment."
Is Epstein&#39;s place up for sale?
"ceramic coat that shit, tint the windows... then we can talk."
The grand dining area in disappointing.
"Sorry, did you say with &quot;Amazon city view &quot;? 🤔"
Man how do you take out the trash then?
How many parking spaces does it come with? Private elevator?
What&#39;s the maintenance fee like?
Ill give you 40 dollars for this.
This place is amazing but it seems a little cold. Maybe different more comfy furnishings. Beautiful place though. A dream.
<b>added sky high penthouse to wishlist of 999+ dream house for sale</b> <br><br>Bank account: $6 <br>It’s okay I’m almost there. Never give up
"Not worth 100,000. New York city sucks and is a shithole."
I would never want to live in that disgusting city.
Beeeyond over priced! The idiot that buys this is a sucker!
LMAO....it should be 17mil tops
Makes you wonder why so many successful people are trying to drop these properties (struggling to sell)…..
Imagine paying 40 million and then having to walk outside your place with a totalitarian face pamper. No thanks!
Hideous
If I had this money now this would be my dream place
That Penthouse would be half the price if the city was run by Republicans.
Breath taking view
Yea Im not paying 40 million to own a piece of property when you dont &quot;own&quot; the building its in lol
"40 million and you still don&#39;t have your own swimming pool, gym, or bowling alley. SMH"
No Effing Way would I want to spend any amount of money to live in that wasteland. No thanks.
Holy crap who would have the money to pay for something like this? Unbelievable. I guess they can look at the homeless people sleeping down on the streets while they&#39;re on the 78th floor having sex with their trophy wife
"Who in the world would want to be on the 78th floor, HELL NO! I’m good on the 1st floor!"
No worries I rather build my own building with that fund.
"78th floor Jesus christ... I went to puerto vallarta last weekend me and my family stayed in a resort with a hotel tower and an apartment tower we were in the twelfth floor, i thought we were in a height place, i cant even imagine how would it feels beeing on a 4x or 5x heigher place i would definetely not set a foot in that balcony, there is no way"
Nice. But I wouldn&#39;t be able to deal with the height!
"Im just not seeing how this is worth 40 million, even more so when you understand it is in NYC which is currently a living nightmare."
"It’s interesting but I didn’t like the tiny rooms, odd shaped rooms, black and white striped walls, the kitchen counter was weird, no ty. I’d not purchase even if I could. Nice views tho. Oh and narrow halls with narrow doors, not wheel chair friendly"
__
Waste of money. No one deserves that.
Meh. Unimpressive. I&#39;ll keep my 100acres
With amazing city views? It fucking better!
"&quot;If you are born poor, its not your fault. But if you die poor, its your fault.&quot; (Bill Gates)"
Neh.. Looks like an office and outdated..
Well I only had an $800 budget... Can we strike a deal 😁
I&#39;ve seen some great real estate of the same price point. This is disappointing for 39 MILLION.
Looking down at a complete shithole city
"You literally could not pay me enough money to make me live there. The last thing I would want is to live in a city full of pushy self-centered New Yorkers. I like fresh clean air, no honking cars and caring people who have no hesitation in helping others, which is why I love our town in Vermont."
Honestly I do uber high end... this is terrible value! wtf? 35 mil for a view...
"If I had to live in it, I wouldn&#39;t buy it for $39,500 👍"
Watching from my car.
meanwhile 9 million people die of starvation in this world every year.
"more proof that the super rich don&#39;t have taste, lol."
aoc lives here......tax the rich
"Seems like a high luxury <a href=""http://prison.no/"">prison.No</a> thanks."
I have New York skylines posters on my bedroom walls I bought for five bucks. <br>I&#39;m happy with that :)
beautiful
A beautiful balcony to throw yourself off when u miss first mortgage payment !!! Or toss ur trophy wife off when she tells u she wants half of it???
"I’ll be back in half an hour, I need to get the pizza."
You have no idea the home you can build in Texas with that kind of money
I pay 1 USD for all
"alright ill say it, this place looks like shit."
"Most of the time when I see videos like this the interiors are over done with expensive treatments without thought to taste. Other than the Kitchen having IMHO ugly stone work (purely a matter of taste), and the kids hallway being head ache inducing stripes, this place was superbly done."
Where’s the yard
This is not worth 40million wtf 😅😅
would much rather have 1000 acres somewhere than a penthouse view of a nasty cosmopolis like NYC.
Anyone who pays that much for anything in NY is a fool. Local government will extort you to no end.
looks Cold in there
You would need a portable GPS to get around.
Woww!!! My place is only 600 sq ft 🤣🤣🥲😅
Que belleza de Vista!
Чет дизайн не очень)
Rich people have such bad taste. They have so much money they dobt know what to do with it. Lets make everything marble!!!
Sorry. Why would any one ever want this. It&#39;s ugly not convenient at all. One of the best in that building just redone you say? Maybe try again. At the price point lol.
This looks exactly like my place. =)
"<a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=idJthveed1M&amp;t=24m02s"">24:02</a> “Please make yourself at home and remember, it’s for sale” – this made me laugh out loud for some reason"
"Very nice, give me a dozen..."
Right smack in the middle of the biggest liberal s*** hole in the United States.<br>Truly some woke genius who&#39;s completely out of touch with reality would love this place. Lol...
Imagine people like Musk getting upset over the thought of paying they’re fair share of taxes 39 million bucks on an apt these are the kinda things people like musk buy.. i dont have a problem with that its awesome ur one of few lucky people who made billions thats fine nobodys hating that.. but dont turn around and get mad when people are talking about you paying ur fair share
"6127 square feet of of space? That&#39;s tiny. My modest 3 bed 2 bathroom character bungalow in a private road in the UK has more than double, it&#39;s only 350k sterling. The views are crap up that high, 8/10 days it will be smoggy or hazy so you can&#39;t see shit also you&#39;re breathing all the nasty pollution from the streets below. Bleugh!"
I wonder if Silverstein had those bars placed in his penthouse so he can get used to the jail cell he needs to be in. He obviously placed his office next to &#39;one world trade&#39; so that he could see the results of his cabal&#39;s machinations.
I want to time travel so badly to 2009 and get some bitcoins
i was reallllly hoping he would mention the views... such a shame
I think it&#39;s extremely cold. City life&#39;s not for me.
If you live here you watch the real squid game
Pretty dope but for 40 mill you can buy a castle. <br>Its too expansive for what you get
Everything is so ugly its looks like a fucking Crate &amp; Barrel in there.
"what a waste, imagine putting that 39 million in bitcoin in 2013"
Loving the comments. Eat the 0.01%
Surprisingly this apartment does not have a parking spot.
Id rather live closer to the ground lol.
rather be in Tokyo
wait what they have a personal elevator that does the whole building ????
I do no want to own it but It would be nice to have a family member who owns this and rent me for free :)
39 mill and no land? Yea that&#39;s a bad investment.
1980s Two television sets? You must be rich!<br>2020s Two dishwashers? You must be rich.
I m good with my apt dont need a place like that very expensive
I look up at this space everyday living in my 3000 sf loft ten blocks away that I pay $1300.00/mo. for.
"Телевизор понравился! Я бы на нём смотрел Соловьева с Киселёвым _о том, как же в USA 🇺🇸 Загнивают и голодают...."
Every time I see the word “penthouse” I immediately think of that explicit magazine. I think they should just call them mansions.
40 million will buy a buttload of a land and a huge fukin home with no Damn Neighbors!!!!…….
And I am here doing my best and still being poor. I think my best isn&#39;t enough. Working all day as much as I can to get 200$ monthly.
I would rather have a FARM
"Let’s face it, not even rich people can really afford this lol."
I want it
not worth it
Is that a latch on the kid’s bedroom window for opening? No way…
Pass
"$40M? Lmao what a joke, you can make a house with prob 50 sq foot with that much money and it would have a pool, mini golf course, tennis court, its own drive. Only an idiot would buy this or someone whos got more money than sense"
Too bad nyc turned into a sh*t hole
"The space might be fine but the interior design is absolutely horrendous; the kitchen, especially the stone surfaces, are atrocious. As we say in the UK, all fur coat and no knickers."
"Actual price: 5 millions.<br>Put &quot;New york&quot; on it, and sell it for : 40.000.000"
"hey gringo, emergency exit in the event of a terrorist attack? explain me"
__🏼the rich.
"Com uma grana dessas eu compro uma puta fazenda no Brasil e ainda pago a manutenção dela por anos. Em termos de investimento, não dá nem pra comparar as duas coisas. Esse apê aí é apenas uma moradia para alguém MUITO rico e que não tá nem aí por pagar um valor desses em algo desse tipo."
Are there incredible views though?
Eat bugs you plebs
La cocina es lo que menos me ha gustado... y eso que me ha gustado... pero no como el resto de la casa.
"Wow with forty mil I believe ny could feed some kids, grown ups, and maybe clean up some streets. My opinion though. Great job on vid."
Great plugage and cabinetry...beautiful floorage space. Minimal tableage and lightage fixurage with Brooklynage views of the city...beautiful toiletage and sinkagery for waterage purposes. Just amazing views of the New Yorkage streetery detailage. Beautifully crafted 🤌🏼
39mil to get cancer early and look at a shit hole lol sure
Vay aminagyum. Ne evler var lan
This video called me poor for 25 minutes
Very Cool. But in the end it would be a 40 million dollar place that I would sit in gaming the whole day and maybe playing the guitar a few hours lol
It&#39;s snowing on the man&#39;s suit and in his eyes. See the level of dedication folks? :)
I remember when going to New York was so exciting.
That&#39;s ridiculous price for that
I watch several YouTube videos on how to trade in the stock market but haven&#39;t made any headstart because they are either talking some gibberish or sharing their story of how they made it and I do not want to make mistakes by taking risks in my own hands
ulan böyle bir evim olacak varya
ur angsish sucks i ma sorry
"Plastic windows, cheap railings, creaky lamps, flimsy doors and echoing rooms are how you can turn a cool apartment into an uncomfortable box. 😐😐😐"
Looks like some1 just have DOOR FETISH. Kitchen in a flat for 39kkk is looks like joke... i mean if i had flat for 39kkk i would prob eat food from good restaurant delivery. This kids area is jesus f#$#$ing hell :DDD
i really was going to buy it but did not like the kitchen
"Amazing view of the city? Ya not possible, there is no part of the city that has an &quot;amazing view&quot;"
Only downside is that you have to live in NYC
"Ok the view is damn nice.....but a penthouse for 39,5 mill....sth. aint right here"
"Ya&#39;ll, I&#39;m looking for 100 people to split the cost with me. Who&#39;s in?"
After revolution defenestrations of exploiters who own appartments like this will look especially impressive.
Larry Silversteen? That guy in on the demolition of the world trade center plus building 7. Pull it
Start spreading the news.....I&#39;m leaving today.....I want to be a part of it....New York New York
Shit views of a Cess pit not for me even. If I had the money !
wow! lockers in the stairs!? who to call about buying this apartment?
"It looks nice, but I don&#39;t like the design of the floor - Parquet floor would look much better."
A gdzie spierdalać jakby jakis samolocik chciał przyparkować?
what a rip-off.
How is it possible that someone dislike this penthouse?! 😱
25 min of bla bla bla...better with short version
and what is its maintenance charges monthly
"Very dope, minus the black and white or jail threads wallpaper. Who done did that??!!"
Some of the designs are dogshit
Una casa da 39 milioni di dollari e non c’è nemmeno un bidet per pulirsi il culo al volo dopo aver cagato
A 39 million dollar house and there is not even a bidet
"I just received a notification from the bank that I can borrow $ 20k for 5 years at an interest rate of 9.7%. So, i only need 39480000 $ or 1k years. <br>Piece of cake."
"<a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=idJthveed1M&amp;t=1m14s"">1:14</a> this marble is a punch in the eye."
The bonsai trees on the balcony is worth more than my house alone.
Thank you for getting those evening shots! During the earlier part of the walk-through that was one of my biggest questions... Amazing!
"Horrific kitchen , bland open styling, just appears a sterile environment to live in, think I&#39;ve seen better looking hospital wards, I&#39;d prefer a highland landscape out the windows than a horrific hell of concrete city with &quot;incredible views&quot;, If I had $40M I wouldn&#39;t be on the 78th floor of a building that could be &quot;hit&quot; with no quick way out. I&#39;d just buy a simple highland retreat with a few thousand acres. However, I suppose you&#39;d get swayed to sleep !!, and the finishes are certainly stunning, they certainly stunned me into unconsciousness. Well &quot;each to there own&quot; said the sparrow sitting on the horses rear waiting for a hot breakfast."
I would put the gym in a space with views to the outside
How the heck can you see Brooklyn and NJ at the same time? Unless you’re a lizard? Lol
"Big a** spaces are great if you have caretakers taking care of your house, cooks to feed you when you feel hungry and have plenty of time to be a daddy to 50-100 children apart from sugar babies around the world, have 25-30 wives who can utilize all that space. You as a single guy would rather be better off owning 1500 sq ft apartment with a 4k tv , gaming console , large a** massage chair sipping lemon juice with a hot girlfriend who will provide soft pillows for a good night&#39;s sleep."
"Does the elevator go all the way down to any mcdonalds? or need to walk down? if no, then it ain&#39;t worth 40 mil. Also, are the views awesome during thunderstorms , can we experience the weather inside home ?"
"<a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=idJthveed1M&amp;t=14m58s"">14:58</a> &quot;I wouldn&#39;t mind watching tv looking at this view&quot; wait what?"
"we have people starving in this country...people on the verge of eviction, and 9 million people watch this...the world is not going to make it if there is THIS MUCH DISPARITY BETWEEN THE RICH AND POOR...this is shameful and accomplishes nothing for anyone EXCEPT THE RICH!!!"
quite expensive average interior taste
look everybody the most selfish people need 39millon homes smh
Disgusting example of how wrong humanity as a species had gone wrong with continents struggling with basic food basic hygiene bad regimes world economy collapsing this is a number 1 example of the wrong road to take there&#39;s no simbiotic relationship here folks just self centred egotism and justification of the selfish way disgusting
"For 40 mil, if they don&#39;t build me a castle i&#39;m not going"
AMAZING VIEWS?? ok ...
"it does not worth the price, too much space is lost with corridor and terrace is too small"
Can those view windows be open? If so it will be very dangerous.
Look you can see all the homeless people from up there ... I wouldn&#39;t live there if it was given to me for free 👎
"Hey, I built this building. I&#39;m pretty sure I used to eat my lunch in the penthouse...when it was bare concrete."
biz de bu hayatı yaşıyoruz sanıyoruz
"Awesome....office area n bathroom and a few other areas felt a little cramped and tight, [windows may have been too small]....but nice apt."
"Who would even buy this? There&#39;s like, 50 people in NYC that actually make this kind of money but thousands of these 40+ million dollar condos. I can&#39;t even imagine the HOA fees on this lmao."
"Ok, fine. Take my 💰"
looks like Ikea designed this
Makes sense for a billionaire if you want cool digs in ny
"It’s lovely, has a killer view, but let’s be honest here: no residence ought to cost that much, not even in New York. Even half-a-million is pushing it as that prices anyone on a regular income right of the housing market altogether, which is just obscene when you think that these are simply supposed to be homes rather than show-pieces or sources of income generation for investors (many of whom are non-tax-paying and/or non-domiciled); it’s a huge issue in Vancouver, for example, and Berlin has just voted to expropriate such investors in a referendum on the matter, so it’s clearly growing as a rather combustible political problem as well."
Whoz the Owner
I’m lowkey not feeling this

"If I had budget like this , I rather built eco homes for all homeless people , can’t take anything with you when die"
"Nice place, but give me a view of a mountain or a lake or something"
&quot;Mikey lets get a close up here&quot;
New york is sosososo nice but i couldnt see myself living there im more of a small city guy
"Horribly mis-designed. It is about as &quot;cold&quot; and unwelcoming as it gets. Refrig and freezer too small.-why not a 36 and 36, instead of a 48? No room next to washer/dryers to fold clothes. Kid&#39;s bedrooms too small. Narrow, confining hallways. Hideous and stark black/white &quot;colors.&quot; Hideous stone in kitchen-makes one want to vomit. No wood. The finishes are all &quot;hard&quot; and uncomfortable."
"SO THAT&#39;s what this weird building is? lol oh my. Not bad. <br>I do Uber Eats, landscaping and drywall repairs. Would they be able to rent it out for... idk...$1,000 a month? ;D<br><br><br><br><br>;D"
That&#39;s not even worth it. It&#39;s in the city. Screw that give me the forest with clean air and no pollution and peace and quiet. Screw your city crap.
Those kids&#39; rooms are creeping me out. Kids growing in such spaces won&#39;t grow up to be normal...
Impressive sure but what a waste of our planet’s resources.
"WTF is a &quot;powder room&quot;? As I understand rich people don&#39;t shit, too nasty for their rich, high tastes, so there are no toliets in their apartaments? :D"
$40m and he still calls it an apartment lmao
Impressive. Very Nice... Let&#39;s see Paul Allen`s Card.
Dış alana çıkan kapının mahmutbey pazarından alınmış beyaz plastik pimaş pakpen doğrama olması değer katmış..
"Hmm 300 houses or one shitty penthouse. 39 million dollar home is a paradox. Soon as someone says 39 mil, it&#39;s a piece of shit because no home is worth 39 mill. Most a house is worth is a mil"
"OK I get it, this price is because of the location, the area you get and the view. Still, 40M and no pool and gym! I couldn&#39;t help but notice ..."
steinberg lol who would have guessed
"Even if I were a Billionaire, I sure as hell would not spend $39.5M on this Apartment, don&#39;t think it&#39;s worth the asking amount."
"To be honest, I always liked my comfy Megaton quarter more than the sterile Tenpenny Tower."
I wonder what insurance for planes crashing into your residence in NYC runs on a $40M penthouse?
It is an eerie feeling imagining myself living in there --- ALONE!!!.

Come on guys..
Enes i can feel in your face that its not worth the money.
Living like the Gods
I do not see $40 million worth of anything. New York is dead.
Such a ripoff 🤦‍♂️<br>U could pay a fraction of that price for more land that isnt congested or polluted
Most of those who can buy it are lonely.
What&#39;s the remaining lifespan of that building?
Говно какое-то. И за 2 ляма рублей бы не взял такую квартиру.
Every one drinks when he says ‘Amazing’!
"Spectacular!!!!, it is a dream."
Wat a shit hole
reminds me of how broke I really am 😀
"Of course it is nice and I suppose no one would say they wouldn&#39;t want a penthouse like this, but 40 000 000 USD for this is damn laughable :)"
It is interesting that the agent here sells the appartment mainly with the interior while it is may be 2% of the overall price. The real topic here is prestige and view. Everything else does not matter at all.
That moving light needs WD-40
"OK, I have already collected 1/1000 of the value of this penthouse"
This place is gross.
Not my cup of tea I’m afraid
Meanwhile in Africa....
I wanna buy this penthouse
Awesome video...I can start with saving some money now :-)
You couldn’t afford this apartment even if you won squid game (~$35 million)
"&quot;you can buy a house , but you can&#39;t buy a home.&quot;"
"I mean I’m from New York, the views are amazing but 39.5 million for an penthouse that’s too much. I prefer to move to the south and build my dream home with that kind of money. No hate tho, great video, keep it up man. Just my honest thoughts"
AMBITIONS &lt;3
If I come home pissed will the guard left me in my own house ?
"Man, that kids space sucks"
It&#39;s nice but not 40 mill dollar nice
"Abi bukadar alıyorsun satıyorsun, bana bir iPhone 13 Pro Max gönderebilirsin? Dolar bazında Parası neyse veririm, söz yeterki elime ulaşsın!!"
The views!!! How many’s times has he said views in this whole video lol
"The view is nice, but only the first 2 weeks. After that, it&#39;s nothing special anymore. <br>40m$ is at least 30 too much. The interior isn&#39;t even beautiful. A soulless overpriced space in a jungle of concrete."
"Is this suppose to inspire us to make more money?? This house is horribly designed and as soulless as an industrial office. Everything is wrapped in dull and depressing colors and hallways are too narrow and unnaturally, really it&#39;s more like a prison than a house. the only awesome thing about it is the killer view of the city which I&#39;m sure after the honeymoon phase would no longer be that exciting when you realize it&#39;s not that great of a scenary considering the polluted air of the NYC and rusty looks of countless old buildings. Definitely prefer a humble average flat to this."
39 millions !! I move to Dubai
$40 million... Probably as much as 40 people making a lifetime of work in a first class country... To live in a room in somebody else&#39;s building. Lol man
"You can build a way much more luxurious, and bigger house on the beach in mexico with just 1M dollars. I know that is that expensive because of land value in NY but still is a waste of money."

terrible
"Human greed is limitless. A person wants to own and own, turning a blind eye to other people&#39;s simple problems, such as hunger. I believe that at the end of time, all people will be worthy of what they have done."

if i cant see central park it aint worth that price
"obsessed with this badass james bond villan lair office at <a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=idJthveed1M&amp;t=4m12s"">4:12</a>"
And when you step out there&#39;s crap needles and pee on the sidewalk lmao
Shitty dining room.
"I would be scared to come close to those windows seeing down from 78/79 floor, even more so to open up!!! But, boy o boy...."
"Here I am living with my parents and my mattress is on the floor, no bed frame"
That building is going to rot no one&#39;s going to live in there bro and if some rich random buy it he won&#39;t even live in it. With 40 million I can make 10 times that penthouse . I would buy it just for my dogs and cat 😂
Any minimalist watching this.
Honestly i&#39;m pretty right-leaning but this makes me want to say Eat the fucking rich
This is simply beautiful and wonderfully presented. We love to vilify those who can afford such a place but to me it&#39;s inspiring. What an amazing home.
"Watching this while I look for what&#39;s left in my fridge and can be consumed as dinner, or even eatable!"
cheaply built. Horrific quality.
I’m about to tell el chapo to up the shipments 🤣😂
Why you talking to me like i can afford it?
my knees got weak every time they showed a view of the city lol.
I would expect a property at this price point would have a private elevator.
NYC is going to go into the dumpster in terms of value. . . only a matter of time if not already.
"The views are amazing, but in no way if I had the money would I pay $40 million for it. Think of the size of the house you could get for 40 million?"
the views are shit. sorry
“With these amazing views of the city”. Points to clouds.
"No pool, no workout room? 40 million?!! Rip off!"
Absolutely breathtaking and inspiring!
A Zillion Trillion Times Overpriced
exquisite!
No shit😂
"This house is suspiciously 45,600,000,000 won."
Ambani- Hold my Antilia😄
Sounds like he has a cold and is trying to hide it.
That one building in spiderman where you meet black cat
I spend nearly 30 seconds to count how many zero in the title..
Why are we watching this?? No one here has 39 million dollars.
"i like how he rounds up $500,000 casualy"
Lol you’re asking for a freak accident buying this place.
Why do you have like 5 different seating areas but tiny tiny bedrooms?? Kids grow up too....
"I don’t aspire to ever have this much money, imagine how soulless the people who can buy this would be…"
A lot of money to live in a hotel.
Super Dupa Fly!!👍🏾👍🏾
"<a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=idJthveed1M&amp;t=23m26s"">23:26</a> what an interesting way to describe someone else covering the charge of your drastic waste of money on the 78th floor"
I still would rather live in my 1000 sq foot house with a nice yard for my doggie for 1/200th of the price...
"<a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=idJthveed1M&amp;t=22m14s"">22:14</a> guy is overly describing a window view as if they were responsible for the cities&#39; construction lmfao"
40 millones de dólares y no hay bidet. Una poronga
No es mi estilo
"I&#39;d live here, but only as my secondary home......"
40 million to share a home with everyone else in the building and you&#39;re still stuck in new york city.
Nice
"Cool stuff, especially the view at night. I&#39;ll take my house in small town rural Wisconsin, though."
Let us peasants see where our masters live.
That&#39;s a hell of a lot of money just to look down on everybody else. You can do it a hell of a lot cheaper at other places.
I just bought this place. I’m so glad everyone finds it amazing. I’m having a move in party next week and you’re all invited!
"I&#39;d much rather be living at my doublewide on 10 acres in Starke, FL w/ my horses, dogs and a cat, nearby the PickQuick where ordinary folks come go and say hello. This penthouse is garbage living, overlooking a concrete nightmare with far too many people. NYC is where you go to do business and get out as fast as you can; but to actually live there is nuts."
"Nice place, too bad it’s in NYC. 👎🏻. Edit, that kitchen is pretty bad."
People buy these usually to rent them for weekly rich visitors
We’re there any safety features for those windows they looked like they had no screens like you can just open them and fall to your death
"It’s still in a Communist state, how ironic!"
"I am ready to make an offer , do you accept shiba coin?"
"“The stone is like, totally cool.” 🤮"
"40 million can buy so much land and a HUGE house why on earth would anyone want to live in a place with vaccine passports and awful politics, if anyone ever buys this they are out of their mind"
Their is no house worth 39 million to me at least lol 😆
"I want a tour of Enes&#39;s house but with the same excitement. Like mine would be, &#39; Look at the incredible wobbling stack of used bowls in this room! Absolutely Gorgeous! &#39;"
Donde firmo el cheque...
"<a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=idJthveed1M&amp;t=0m40s"">0:40</a>. Dat yarmulke burn-in, lol."
I would be more worry about safety than luxury. When emergency I feel like no one can hear you or can be reach.
"If you pay that sum of money for somewhere to live, you are a f*cking idiot, and don&#39;t really live with the rest of humanity."
This house looks like an office style<br>which is something I don&#39;t like as a residence
"How many lattes you think we have to skip to work hard, and save up enough to live in one of these?"
"This is just wrong. For one or two people that live in that kind of opulence while over 80,000 men, women and children sleep on the street every night in NYC is digusting. What a fucked up society we live in."
What an obscenity.
"$40,000,000 and you don&#39;t even get an inch of your own piece of land"
Tax the rich
"These people don&#39;t like color, do they? Everything so plain looking, almost depressing at some points. The views are great, and you get some color with the views at night."
"<a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=idJthveed1M&amp;t=15m32s"">15:32</a> why does this part look like a Sephora"
idk if i could ever live in the city. especially for 39million you could do a heck of a lot better then that little space. you could buy tons of acers and build a better hose then that.
Bobby Axelrod fallen on hard times...had to sell the NY condo.
I wish I could live in a place like that!
"It really isn&#39;t that good for its price, I&#39;m not saying it doesn&#39;t look good, looks beautiful, but with a little bit of effort and even creativity you can make a house look like that, or at least close to that, might be expensive, but it&#39;ll definitely be less expensive than this, I just think the price is more about the location and views than what&#39;s inside, it also has a lot of unnecessary things (in my personal opinion)."
"Yea, it is ugly throughout. I can get better for $1m"
"<a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=idJthveed1M&amp;t=17m55s"">17:55</a> Damn.. that closet is bigger than my room ;_;"
"I&#39;ll take my little log cabin in the woods instead! Also, I don&#39;t think I&#39;d give up views of trees and nature just to see man-made skyscrapers in a foggy haze. I love architecture too but, idk. Something just seems so claustrophobic about living here, despite the beauty of it all."
This does nothing for me. Give me a place in the mountains.
Omah larang-larang tapi ora iso nggo dolanan benthik
If I had 40 million to spend I would make it my own. That stone looks like garbage.
No thank you. Would have to pay me 50 mill to live in that terrible city
"<a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=idJthveed1M&amp;t=2m34s"">2:34</a> you can see the cia building with no windows"
The last thing I want a view of is more city..... The things we waste money and space on......
"Interesting, prison stripes for the kids area. Makes me nauseous just looking at it."
Awesome.... but you can&#39;t really be afraid of heights.<br>Especially that tiny balcony on the 2nd floor... I mean 79th floor.<br>I couldn&#39;t even go out on their veranda thing on the 78th.
only the shoes in this apartment are more worth than my bank account
"This is not worth 39 million at all, this looks like a college dorm."
"I guess if u have everything it would make sense, but it sure doesn&#39;t to me."
40 million and the washer and dryer are stacked like an Alabama trailer. No thanks.
hope you realize half the audience secretly want to toss you down the balcony. this is america.
no offense but the steelcase doors and paneling give off a prison vibe
"10 max, go buy a ranch in texas."
meh...not worth more than 3 million in my opinion
Imagine wasting 40 mil on apartment in soulless concrete menace with views of other concrete abominations that is located in &quot;diverse&quot; hell hole instead of buying land somewhere.
40m USD in NYC goes a lot farther than 80m USD in Hong Kong
Idk if i would want to be that high up my dumbass would probably fall over one day when im drinking
As soon as SHIBA INU hits $.01..Ill buy it.
only 40 million ????? that means whoever buys it and flips it 10 times... that would be like... $400 million
"I consider myself blessed financially, and I could probably afford this, but it’s not worth 40 million. The views are the only thing attractive. Also whoever designed this horrible creation should never design a home again! I wouldn’t pay more than 10 million for this, actually I wouldn’t buy it at all! Sorry not sorry"
I’m assuming it’s an older building as there are many walls within the home. It’s certainly not an open concept by any means.
not worth the money
"Meanwhile people in NY are sleeping on the streets, and their democrat leaders want to pay for more immigrants to illegally cross the border...Send money to other countries to pay for sex reassignment surgery, and accuse American parents of being terrorists because they don&#39;t like their schools teaching racist critical race theory. Fk NY, and every other liberal hell hole."
"That&#39;s about the sum you&#39;d have to pay me to live in that shithole, on second thought I&#39;ll probably use that money and buy a ranch in TX"
"All I need to do is save up 2,356 lifetimes, and I would still be short the downpayment."
"За такие деньги можно купить несколько гектаров земли в России и жить на природе. Эти любители пентхаусов явно извращенцы, вид из окна отвратительный, бетонная коробка, человейник. Один плюс, банкир будет прекрасно лететь с балкона совершив суицид. Там у них любят выпрыгивать из окон, когда счета им обнуляют."
"Stop being poor, people"
The height blocks out all of the shootings and crime occurring from down below!!

It makes me so sick to see something this expensive when people are sleeping on the street
This is actually grotesque and obscene.
Can you not sell it til the money comes to me?
Can&#39;t wait to get the next stimulus check so I can put my $600 deposit down
One day...
Can you imagine how beautiful that would be when it’s snowing? I could stare out the windows all day❤️
I’m sorry but the amount of unskippable ads on this video are absolutely ridiculous
Views of a brokeback disgusting overrated overpriced city?...sweeeet
Why is this guy needs some mucous medicine.
Really for this money !!! no good !!! It ´s no special !!! I don´t understand why this price ???
Hahahahahahaha
too high. i am afraid of heights. not for me. lol
"I think I&#39;d keep the 39.5 million, buy a house with twice as much space for 5 million, and live off the rest..."
Most of these rooms look small and crammed.
People who live there poop 💩 is full<br>Of gold and diamond
40mil and no soft close doors in the kitchen.
"It&#39;s alright, I have the same color toilet paper at my place."
39 million to breath in that amazing pollution.
Great views! The homeless people look like ants from up there.
I open the back door and my dogs run down the deck stairs to chase in my backyard. I can lean over my deck rail and talk to my neighbors. I’m only asking twenty million
"df for 39,500,000 dollars i dont want you to fucking walk or breath the same air"
LOL. Start saving my paychecks and buy this property then move al my Latin family. Party all day everyday in this pad.
Time to get out of New York it’s going down like California. Sell Now Fast Get your Money now.
I would be just as happy in my $800 apt as I would in a $39 mil apt.
Rich Libs priced everyone out lmao
Elon Musk made enough money last Monday to purchase 900 units just like this one? Just sayin&#39;.
"Too bad that wonderful pad is in shity NY 😂 I can tour the Empire State Bldg. and see all that view for 20$<br>Dubai, LA, SF, Miami, Paris, Milan, Barcelona would move me a bit more honestly.<br>No ones pissing on the sidewalk.<br>Very impressive though."
Is this guy stupid or what he tells you look out we&#39;re in tribeca look at this great view and it&#39;s total clouds of smog there is no view suckers
I wouldn&#39;t even pay 10 million for it. I don&#39;t like the view. But that&#39;s just me
Nothing like a view of a crime ridden liberal shithole lol
It&#39;s not even worth 10% of that price HAHAHAHAH XD. The pricing on properties like these are redicilous
Daammnnn. This better come with a parachute in case of emergency. 😬😬😬😅😅😅
It&#39;s beautiful! Here I am choosing which drugstore make up is cheaper.
meh
I wonder how much are the property taxes
I would love to visit a place like this. I would hate to actually live there.
I don&#39;t know guys but i feel uncomfortable thinking that I live there. I&#39;d rather buy a big mansión with 10 millions a lot of pretty land around It. An with the rest live peacefully.
Can imagine at night it must come to life. I&#39;d say your paying for million dollar views but in this case is 40 million dollar views!
rather greg normans $40m ranch
"Maybe it’s because i have different taste, but it seems cold."
I&#39;m so poor I have to reuse paper plates.
And then me with three kids who still rents and goes gold panning for extra income
So sad these people who think $$$ will bring them joy. They’re probably the most miserable lonely people!! What is it to gain the whole world &amp; yet lose your very soul!!! You have do much to bring in the poor to sleep in the floor!!
reserved for only the truest criminals
"the Hearst castle is really something to see, THIS, isnt very imopressive. despite the great views of the concrete jungle."
it&#39;s pretty shitty for a 40 millions place to be honest. I would expect a lot more if I didn&#39;t know it&#39;s in new york.
Homeless people dwelled in the Colosseum of Rome for a few hundred years.
Nice views. But the design is average/below average
What a view this place had for all the BLM rioting two summers ago.
"This reminds me of that scene in Austin Powers....Dr. Evil, this is 1969! That amount of money doesn&#39;t even exist. The President : &quot;I want a kajillion bajillion dollars.&quot; That&#39;s how I feel when the asking price is forty million for a penthouse.😆"
"Ah, a cancerous city."
I’m interested where do I inquire
Shit not even my dream would be able to afford this 😩😂
I would not choose to live in the city if you GAVE me that place. .
$40mil and they didn&#39;t bookmatch the stone beside the stove.
"Same thing in Alabama with mountain top views costs $600,000 state taxes are not crippling and you can go to restaurants…. I would not buy for $300,000"
40 mil?......psssh
"I could think of literally countless other things I’d buy with $40,000,000…."
inanılmazz !!!
How do you take your groceries up there?
Not worth it
"i’d rather put that $40,000,000 into a house and 200 acres lol because fuck society 😂"

Pretty cool
Who&#39;s the owner ... Bruce Wayne or Lex Luthor?
Ужасный дизайн. Полосатый коридор - это ужас!

When I get my neural link I’m going to live the rest of my life plugged in while my real body survives in a pod being fed with cheap ass nutrients. I could probably retire and live out my life that way on like nothing and live a paradise in the neural link world
SCAM
Theres no self made billionaires on a planet of earth🙏🏼
That is so great! You will die like the rest of us and be forgotten!<br>No amount of cash will help you out!<br>Cheers :)
Nice pinhouse. But there&#39;s still dinosaur rats roaming in the neighborhoods. <br>All that money and still surrounded by rats
hmmm. I might buy it
"Stark decor that feels more like a hotel, views of a smoggy city... for that money you could buy a beautiful home in the woods with your own waterfalls."
Holy shit but def not worth 40 million evene the style/design imo on the inside isn&#39;t worth 40 million
Our of sheer curiosity....what does the monthly HOA/maintenance payment look like on a $40M apartment in NY?
Você é brasileiro?
"My dad is a woodworker and I dont understand how they can put those ugly industrial lockers in a multi million dollars penthouse... just hire someone to make something handmade, it will be prettier, more robust and more adapted to the space.<br>interesting video anyways :)"
Lots of steins....from concentration camps to riches.....lmao 🤣🤣🤣
Too bad a plane couldn’t take that high rise down. Screw you douche bags
Thank you...we just came to agreement to purchase this unit. Overall very satisfied! RTG Group
Couldn’t pay me to live there
waaay overpriced. xD
Do you take BTC?
I don&#39;t understand how looking out on a bunch of concrete is appealing??
"just need SHIB to go up another 100,000% and im buying this!"
yaaaaawwwwwwwwnnn
"This is a stunning piece of property, I think it is made for billionaires alone though. The price is heavy and for selected few."
With that kind of money there&#39;s no way in hell I would spend it just to look at other buildings in New York City that place is a garbage dump I&#39;d be laid up somewhere South of the border
There&#39;s no way imma have a place like this and be alone. <br>We&#39;re all staying there bruh.
"Not a very wise money decision.<br>Even if you have that type of money, so many better investments to be made.<br><br>Yes the penthouse is beautiful and the outside scenery is very compelling, just saying...."
Dont get upset that this is outside your price range. If you watch any apocalyptic film all the rich die downtown new York either from alien attack. Terrorist or my favorite a biological dease slash zombie death......Doesn&#39;t that feel better that money won&#39;t matter......Cheers
Instead of pay per view it’s pay for view the place itself I wouldn’t buy for that much but the view might tempt me 🤣🤷‍♂️
"ладно уговорил, беру!!"
&quot;views are simply amazing&quot;<br><br><b>layer of smog in the distance</b>
i call amazing views the sky the sun and the countryside new york is a concrete jungle and a shit hole.
"What they don&#39;t tell you is what all the blue-collar workers with access to your secrets and yuor private life can do behind yuor back in NYC. Those places have to be staffed 24/7 and it&#39;s very easy for the wrong people to slip in. Much safer to appear broke in an apartment building with no doorman, an absentee owner, etc., especially in the internet age."
Doesn&#39;t seem safe. this residence is quite clearly too high up
the bonsai are of poor quality. lika a 100 dolar tree
"Better have a helicopter to fly over the rats, as they infest your million dollar penthouse."
No thank you..
"Yawn. I grew up on the UES back when those apartments rented for $1,100 a month."
bathrooms look like jail cells ..marble and panel walls uck...and echos are still echoing..you relly like it .good luck sellin rhat pre historic dinosaur appr
"Everything in the eye of the beholder I guess. Some one would gladly shell out almost 40 million to live there, some may stretch themselves financially cuz they want to live there, and I wouldn&#39;t live there if you paid me to."
Omg
Call me crazy but it looks lonely and hella creepy being that high. I think I will find excuses just to leave the house lol
Eat the rich.
but can you smell the NY sewer is the real question?
Don’t like it one bit
I hate how expensive places like this look and probably feel like a soulless doctors office.
Half the price of a falcon it’s not that crazy put in perspective
90% of those which can buy this are deeply sad inside
"In this shit pandemic I’ll rather to stay with my $40,000,000 thx !😎"
"Let&#39;s say, somebody lives in there for 50 years. That&#39;s 220 $ per day."
Tony soprano wouldn&#39;t even afford this.
Esse corretor vende areia no deserto. Sabe valorizar o produto.
Don&#39;t know why i am watching this...i have 1700 rupees in my bank account 😐
meanwhile i clean the cheese cup after i eat all cheese and i use it for morning coffee
Amazing Presentation of the unit. They kinda scuffed and limited the 2nd floor space with the kids area. Those 3 rooms are tiny and an adult or even a teen probably wouldn&#39;t be comfy in them. Not 40mill comfy anyway. Also having a direct access door from hallway to kids area is kinda worrying. The whole kids space should have opened up or made in to 2 rooms rather than 3 partial rooms.
"this is what i thought usa was and where id live when i came here instead i lived in junk like the rest of you, literally hated everything about it especially food, water, and everything 🤢🤮"
my house looks better and is nowhere near 40M dollars. You just pay that for a &quot;New York Penthouse&quot;. That&#39;s it. Same appartment outside New York would be like 800k max.
Scammer
This is the life I live in GTA V.
what a steal
Seems like a cold and unforgiving space. For the money? Surely NYC has better?
OMG! Who the hell is able to buy this apartment? Its literally a dream. Nice vid guys! Keep going.
40 milion? Scandal

"views of a shithole city, you can keep it"
I would rather have a small cabin in the woods
I cannot imagine a worse kind of hell than living in NYC.
If I had that money I would way rather have a huge detached house on a riverside or an oceanic coast.
Merecido cada milhão 💴💶💰<br>Belíssimo imóvel 👏👏👏
That’s nice for a second home if you have all the money in the world but riding the elevator everyday no thank you.
"So you have a 40 million appartment and when you get down to the streets there is homeless and crack heads everywhere, i dont see the point of having so much money if your neibourgs are so poor."
"<a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=idJthveed1M&amp;t=17m03s"">17:03</a> Bosch washer and dryer - Miele was too expensive"
"In Moscow, 900 sQ m without repair with current prices, repairs cost about as much as the apartment itself😄 The average salary in Russia is $ 850 😂And 100 million people receive 500 dollars a month😄🙈😂And 100 people receive 500 million dollars each month, and most of them are illegal🙈😄😂"
I just don&#39;t see 40mil worth of anything there....
"At the beginning, we can see too many parts of house that close with a door or glass. Don&#39;t like it. It made me feel like I was in a maze. However, look at the view. Its incredible"
How much was the maintenance fees?
My poor brain can’t handle this!!
If I had 40 million NYC is the last place I&#39;d spend it.
"The whole place feels very clausterphobic to me. Being so isolated from the outside world would be irritating to me. There are no doubt a lot of beautiful features of the place, but it feels more like a museum or an office than a home. It just doesn&#39;t have a comfortable feel and that&#39;s where I have to limit my modern styling. Some of it just isn&#39;t comfortable and gets a bit too cold/sterile."
Buying this with my shiba inu gains lol.
"Um no. I’ll keep my 4,200 sqft home on 1190 acres here in west Texas for $900k."
"Absolute joke if this is worth nearly $40,000,000! It’s only worth what people would be willing to pay for it. For me, I wouldn’t pay more than $2,000,000 for it. It has cheap PVC windows throughout for Gods sake! No wonder there’s a huge property crash coming and financial meltdown! Property is completely fu*<b>*</b> if anyone thinks or would be willing to pay $40,000,000 for this! It ain’t even that nice! You’d be nuts!"
Cuanto salen los gastos comunes???
I want it
nice view
Matthew 16:26 For what will it profit a man if he gains the whole world and forfeits his soul? Or what shall a man give in return for his soul?
"very sterile everything, like in a clinic. but for people with a lot of money it is definitely the right thing! nice and far away from real life and nice and clean everything, then you can best manage your constraints!"

I have suddenly started getting these prime real-estate vids. Does the algorithm know something I don&#39;t? With 40 mill I would buy a Greek island and live in a bivouac.
"39 milioni e non hai neanche un bidet per pulirti il culo, bah..."
"<a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=idJthveed1M&amp;t=10m48s"">10:48</a> Is THAT what they&#39;re calling a chandelier these days?? lol I&#39;m pretty sure IKEA sells that same ugly-ass light fixture for like 30 bucks. If I&#39;m spending $40 million on a condo, I&#39;d at least want a better looking chandelier in my kitchen.<br>I will say, however, those views are beautiful. And best of all, the apartment is above the smog cloud!"
Draws in stairs look like a serious safety hazard.
"Amazing views: buildings and more buildings.... People working in office buildings see this all day, free. When I go home, I would like to see something else."
If you have money to waste on this.. good for you.. I don&#39;t see myself spending that type of money for this place.. rather travel the world and see what the world 🌎is hiding.. taking a elevator everyday to sleep.. nope
"nice place, bad design...."
For 40 mil kinda seems like a waste of money
I &#39;d rather buy 40 1 millions houses and rent em lol
"the patio was the coolest thing in my opinion, it was such a vibe."
There is someone here capable to buy something like this?
"Lol. I can get a better view out of my $2,800 Jeep on a mountain top and not pay $1 property tax"
39 mil in NY really don&#39;t get you shit
Beautiful penthouse
Amazing view of the smog!
I’d rather live in a trailer home in West Virginia but hey that’s just me
No

ONE DAY🙏🏽🤞🏽

"I feel like whoever can afford that place, will be far too busy with their work and status to even enjoy that place. For some reason it feels more isolated than a house in the mountains, there&#39;s something eerie about living on top of the world in a property like that, as you are not part of the world."
People who can afford this possesses such levels of obscene wealth it’s disgusting. The pitchforks should come and come hard
What about such an expensive apartment in a city that is about to drown?
Man what is life to you once you reach this point of wealth…
“Natural stone” or Apoxy??? Million $ question
"I would love to have this penthouse as my own. I would then sell it, buy a normal house in a beautiful mountain river valley, a beach house on both coasts of the United States, and use the rest to travel with my family around the world."

Tooo many mirrors! And you were touching all of them!!
I can only dream! One day staying there would be a dream come true!
lol the grand dinning area is pathetic. your run of the mill upper middle class american family has a better dining area. this is 39 million dollar home? nyc really sucks man
No thanks
Where&#39;s the gym? Really?
In India you can buy nearly 10k acres of land with 40M
"Mir bleibt der Mund offen stehen 😮😳, wer kann sich so etwas leisten?"
中国深圳湾1号 比这个豪华多了
Blow it up no one should have a property worth more than a million
I think your really just paying for the view in New York
Sólo un imbécil pagá tanto por nada....10 hectáreas díez casas residenciales de 6 recamaras con baño privado...seis albercas canchas de tenis cada uno.. bosque de árboles frutales y un lago.. costo solamente 10 millones de dólares... y con aire puro sin contaminación.. espacio para 80 autos.. una tranquilidad y armonía que no te da nueva York... así es mi humilde residencia en un maravilloso lugar de mi bello México... y a 100 metros del mar...🏄🚣🏊🏃🚵🌲🌳🌴 Saludos cordiales..
and you running with your shoes in that luxury house.
Me to my brain: “take a good picture of this so I can dream of living in it tonight”…….
Fun fact phizer has had record quarterly earnings since biden took office…let’s go Brandon
__💯
Will make a great home for no one but it&#39;ll make a good investment for US or Chinese corps.
Should’ve taken your shoes off brah
Floors that high in NY give me 9/11 anxiety I cant do it
$39.5m and you buy an apartment that over look NY 🤢<br>I can think of a whole lot better places to buy for that kind of money.
"I have enough savings in my account to afford the door mat to this place. If I keep saving, in about 345 years, I&#39;ll be able to afford a place like this!"
can someone just give me $40 million so I can buy this penthouse? Thanks in advance...
beat sounds like two songs at once?
Imagine what 40M can buy you in Texas or Georgia 🤣 NYC is top on my list of places NOT to live. The people there and crime rate also significantly back my decision lol
EAT THE RICH
And to think I went to bed hungry tonight. What a great country we live in. I guess this place isn&#39;t for a Christian since they are instructed to store their wealth in heaven. Disgusting!
So cool to see 40 million spent on a house in the sky so you can look diwn on the millions who dont have anything. This is so awsome. Hooe you feel giod knowing people are dying beneath you.
"So strange what people think is “outstanding”... That black and white kid section was downright horrifying...<br>Designers in their attempt to outdo with shock and awe end up with cold and uncomfortable. But this is just my uncultured opinion, lol"
It comes with an emergency parachute I hope lol 64th floor next to the trade center sheesh lmao
Amazing view with amazing air 😆 🤣 😂
They can sit on your grave wen you die
Do you mean the owner pays 325k / month for just property tax? should we believe this?
“Time is the last luxury”<br>That hits deep this times
Just wow!
"For $39,500,000 million this penthouse better come with at least a few models from the magazine included in the price. Like I watch this videos and I think about who would buy this place. Its just complete and utter opulence."
Except for the great views everything else is ugly and narrow and disorganized
I’m watching this on the crapper. I’m gonna wipe with 1 ply TP 😫
This is nice but 40 million is far too much lol
Wouldn’t pay a million for this place if I were going to live in it. I’d pay that in a heartbeat though if I could rent it🤣
But will it keep me from getting in an argument with my fiancé? No. So why would I waste 40 million on it?
"Impressive, very nice… Let’s see Paul Allen’s penthouse."
Nice as it is ....looks like hotel decor .....all neutral decor is for unsophisticated wealthy people or &quot;new money&quot; .
39 millie? I don&#39;t think so.
Typical NY luxury penthouse...about $9.5 million for the penthouse and $30 million for those views. Wow.
"For that price, I&#39;d expect a negative edge pool surrounding the outdoor patio, crystal blue water with a full serviced wetbar, everything in marble, with projection tvs all around playing music videos, and that great city view. This guy wasted his money! 😩,"
Nema ovde srece u ovim zidovima
Who the hell would want to live in new York I&#39;m good !!! No way
No front yard and no backyard? No thank you.
Sold?
not impressed with a single thing I have seen in this video except the view of new city itself.
The master bedroom views are priceless
$40M and you own no land? You couldn&#39;t pay me to live there.
I mean it’s really nice don’t get me wrong but I would not spend 40 mill on this. There is so much good in the world I can do with 40 mil. You can’t take money with you when you die. Changing peoples lives for the better now that’s a feeling of satisfaction you can take with you to the next life.
If I walk to my window and have to see NYC someone owes me money
"<a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=idJthveed1M&amp;t=14m11s"">14:11</a> Why Are there 2 dehumidifiers in that room? Humidity in a 40 million home? That doesn&#39;t sound right to me. No good insolation around the place?"
"And it&#39;s not yours. I have a small brick home and most important, I have 50acres of land. Closest thing to land these people have is the floor which is the roof of the one under you."
That is what&#39;s wrong in this world. I don&#39;t care if the view shows the entrance to Heaven! You get the owner to go take a crap and me as an average everyday person to take a crap in the other bathroom and still gonna smell like crap!
Interiors look really basic for a 39 million come on <br>It has no taste to it at all
Who df calls a shower a water closet that&#39;s so weird
Definitely wouldn&#39;t be the main residence.
"This is Fabio your assistant showing you all the new features you just bought, feels like we own it already"
"good architectonic place but it is in the middle of a shitty soulless place. New York is over, the price is going down the toilet as the city."
Where do I send my deposit?
That’s not worth it for $39.5m
More money than sense comes to mind.

"Rats I only have $38 million to spend - oh well, I&#39;ll keep looking."
Who the fkk%%%%%k has 40 million dollars!!
"☝️☝️I CAN’T STOP TO BE THANKING HIM BECAUSE HE PUT A SMILE ON MY FACE AND I WILL ALWAYS BE GRATEFUL,❤️👈YOU’VE DONE A LOT IN MY LIFE 🙏⚡️👆👆"
the kitchen is underwhelming
I&#39;m watching this while eating Cream of Wheat for dinner.
"Nice to see that there are great opportunities for automating the entire process. I appreciate your full transparency here! It&#39;s not a get rich quick field, there&#39;s lots of learning and most often you&#39;ll learn from mistakes. I suggest you seek the help of an expert as a beginner."
"Hoping a Garage Truck Size Meteor Flyby and Lands on this Part of Manhattan, hopefully,Gates,Bozo,Suckerberg, and. Musk Are home,"
You have to be kidding the place looks and feels cold.
In reality its really only worth 2.million at most
"The kitchen is a masterpiece. I would’ve had a long rectangular wooden expensive detailed farm table instead of the round one. This apartment has some truly exceptional features, wow. The outdoor balcony, and really too much to mention, like the privacy, as you’re higher up than anything around. Also enjoy the discussion between you and your cameraman."
"40 mil, id buy a small home in the bayou, with a big outdoor eating area, a good boat, hunt gators and craw, make good food daily for anyone that needs a meal, and open a cultural center for all the kids to keep track and or learn the Cajun way of life"
I put a bid on that place and was outbid by $1.00. 😞
Sure the place is nice but at the end of the day you still live in New York City
I cant even watch the video..the heights give me anxiety.
no - beautiful but not in a pit like NY. I could not enjoy it knowing all the suffering going on below.
Gta 5 videosu sanıp girdim xhdbsjzn.
Overpriced
It almost feels kind of cosy actually… pretty rare of penthouses
El departamentito de mis sueños!!! jajajajajaja
The localization made the price so high.
So why is it empty?
The world has enough for everyone&#39;s need but not for everyone&#39;s greed!
"Nice one, though I wouldn&#39;t exchchange my house even with this penthouse."
Amazing View is when you see the Nature bro not the concrete jungle
Maybe 4 million...not at all worth 40....Jesus....even if I had billions
I would eat a 1 dollar cup of ramen noodles on this spectacular balcony.
That nature light though

ah shit depression got worse
"40 mil to live in NYC, the traffic, the chaos, and when I look outside my windows I have to overlook the city? No thank you. Its not a pretty view at all."
I should have Google telling me now: why you&#39;re watching this if you cannot afford even a tram ticket 🤣
"If you had this much money, why would you live in such a liberal, commie shithole like NYC???????"
You can buy an island for 40m. lol
Imagine paying 39M for this.
Absolutely epic. You guys are doing a good job. I really couldn’t live 78 floors up though.
As P.T. Barnum said..&quot;Theres a Sucker Born Every Minute. NYC STILL HAS RATS...CRIME..ETC
That&#39;s 19.5 million dollars for the property and 20 million dollars for the view.....
No amount of money can keep that cold out.
Getting a penthouse is my biggest dream<br>In the next few months in crypto i believe i can achieve that
no es calida precio
Ich würde nicht mal 10 Euro geben
"Maybe one day ...you or me , will get this !!!! Time is money"
"One thing I don&#39;t get it: you have a very expensive apartment, but when you go to the toilet, the windows are crystal clear. it&#39;s not like your neighbours will see you- you&#39;re on the 78th floor, but still- don&#39;t you want some blurred windows?"

"Just the camera movement is making my vertigo act a fool, but is a stunning and openly lit space there!"
this house .. im sorry. this PENTHOUSE is really a vibe you could literally use every space in this house and it’d be a perfect background 😭🤝
"Great views, too many doors"
"Klozetler ve rezervuarlar çok demode gömme yapılabilirdi. Bence çok baskın detaylar var siyah beyaz duvarlar ,mutfak tezgahı mermeri hiç uyumlu değil abartı dolu"
It looks like an airport.
"Its amazing that someone would need to look down on so many. I couldn&#39;t spend so much on myself, when I know so many people with so little."
I will be too scared to live way up there. It is too high.
would be weird living so high. interior very uninspired. it’s a home for an empty suit
I’m going to have one just like it 🤗
That would suck to pay that much for so little.
Seize and it and convert it to public housing
Looks cool but you couldn&#39;t pay me 40 million to live in the concrete jungle
"You guys rock ! Made a killing just listening to y’all ! What’s your thoughts on Jojo inu ? It’s Crypto .They’re doing nfts ! Small amount of holders and have half the coins burnt with a burning and anti whale added, Tell me what u think.. pretty bullish. 🙌🏼🚀"

Que apartamento incrível.
Maybe in Dubai but ny your 🤪
The maintenance fees alone you could have a peacfull mansion with more privacy and possibly better views if you like anything other than concrete.
"Excellent, I&#39;ve got 500 bucks so I better start saving ;)"

Nah… anytime a plot of land in the Canadian Rockies and a modest house.
ok
"All that money to be surrounded by people, life is funny"
That’s a lot of extra weight. Wouldn’t catch me up there lol

"I&#39;m more of a country girl that would rather have a nice cabin in the woods. But, unfortunately I can&#39;t afford it. I&#39;d be lucky to buy a nice tent much less a 40 million dollar penthouse geeeezzzzz whizzzzzz"
Can I get a tour? I won&#39;t buy it.
Can you tell us who is the current owner of this unit?
"I like some of the finishes in it, but on the total It just doesn&#39;t feel like a home at all. <br><br>Hope whoever buys it enjoys it. The &quot;kids&quot; section would have to be completely redone."

imagin paying all this money to live at that shithole city
How can I ever reach this in my life.
This place is obviously incredible. Serious question though: who is the target clientele?
Not for you bunch of hobos in comment sec.
It’s listed 39.5M but I won’t sell for that. U can but down 10% and move in.
Is the HOA like 500K/month?
Why am I watching this at 3 AM having 20$ in my bank account :/
"&lt;I respect your work mate, because you are pointing people in the right direction, massive pumps coming soon. It is manipulated but that can be a good thing if you understand it. We should all know that when these reports are bullish take some off to the side lines, when news gets bearish start buying. &quot;Keep it simple simple&quot; that bear/ correction was the best thing that happened me, but all thanks to Norman Berg for his amazing skills that helped me earn 25 BTC in less than a 6 months through his trading patterns. I believe we are in a season of big pumps."
I can afford the Aesop handsoap in the bog
I will buy this penthouse if shiba gets to 1 dollar
Must be amazing to live there! Just an impossible dream but i enjoy watching and dreaming :D

I’m broke but I’m still disappointed by this place. It’s not your fault tho you did a good tour
Gorgeous 😍 I knew this was a Compass listing once I saw it. I used to temp in a few of their offices.
"Looks nice, but too bad it&#39;s in NY."
The only thing which is being showed and would be sold are the views. Otherwise all other set ups are usual. I think for 5m you can get 90 times better than this one in Frankfurt Germany or bit expensive in Dubai
Don’t like the kitchen worktop looks like a zebra skin 😀
"Given such a small square footage, comparatively speaking, it&#39;s overpriced imho."
Behold! peasants
No way I had 39 million this is what I&#39;m buying.
Everyone deserves to live in such an incredible penthouse! Thanks for sharing this video🙏❤️
Amazing view of smog
"Worth every penny, stunning"
Too much for me
Amerikaner hatten noch nie Geschmack 😅
"Брать не буду, вида на брайтон бич нет, на русский магазин тоже..."
He really likes a lots if stuff. 🤪
"with my startup, ill def be able to afford this. but im not driven by this materialism anymore. that will come. im doing this to impact the world."
It even has its own elevator. Bro for the price it better have its own fucking elevator 😂. Talking like it’s a bonus
Imagine comming home and you forgot to buy milk. -Fuck!
ammount of cash invested is mega low compared to sale price.... yeah modern minimalism brings low cost too lol

"Amazing views and location, but the decor is simply tacky and an eyesore. I can&#39;t believe that something costing this much has the interior design of a hotel with zero warmth or character...."
Живут живут люди))
"40 milioni e manco il bidet, che sporchi"
"I couldn&#39;t live there, I&#39;d just get the urge to jump everyday.😝"
40 million to be stripped of your rights for a view of a shit hole? Clearly you can tell who grew up there and who didn&#39;t...ask anyone who was once trapped in that cesspool if they&#39;d ever spend 40 million to live there? They will laugh at you on their way to acreage somewhere far from there 😂😂😂
If I had 39 million I definitely would not spend it on that.
why do you need 5 bathrooms ?
Pretty claustraphobic
You don’t need anymore adjectives those views speak for themselves. Spectacular 💕
I would never buy that even if I had the money. The money could be used for so many things.
No he visto nada de otro mundo. Lo que más me ha impactado ha sido el precio.
who would want to live in new york these days
"Необоснованно дорого, красная цена 1300000$ max..."
Urban people are pathetic!
Now that&#39;s a George Costanza bathroom!
Hideous style
What a waste of money I can build a mansion with 1 million don&#39;t need a shitty penthouse
I&#39;d rather have my own island for 39million
Quero fazer uma oferta ...
Yo whats up people watching this vid ngl the real title is inside a home you cant afford
"Live in New York, no way for me."
Will the government buy me one 🤣🤣😂
Leonard is a plummy -choked bullshitter...... If the audience &quot;want everything&quot; they would be landing their HELICOPTER and being elevatored down.... - RIDICULOUS just to look out... take a ride up the Empire FFFS ONCE A WEEK !!! Design Failure for little Miss OR Master richDad
__💚💙💗💛
Trying not to be ugly but the in-designers Daddy must be connected !!!! $40m fucked -up. Luckily the location and VIEWS will save this from being a total loss. Cannot believe this was created in THE YEAR 2021 YUCK
Dining area from IKEA ???/
No disRESPECT but that kitchen is TRULY AWFUL. The colours and materials are non-complementary to each other and just wrong ... Sorry that would make me ill living with that .
What a lovely view of the pollution I&#39;m sure!
Its expensive
Me pergunto o quão grande é o patrimônio de alguém que compra algo nesse valor.
"I look at this from a practical standpoint. Grocery shopping…nightmare lugging your groceries up 78 floors. No thanks. Living space very nice with curved marble fire place and giant windows, but where am I putting my TV?"
Be fucked if lift brakes
Great views of millions living in poverty below you!
All fun and games until u see an aeroplane headed towards you.....
Yeah but who wants to live in NY.
It&#39;s very &quot;meh&quot; for the price. I would rather buy a forest
Simply amazing 👏😍
"too many doors, rooms, narrow aisles &amp; no 360° around the balcony view.<br>therefore massively overpriced… 👎"
39mil only to find out the elavator out of order
Better be good for 45million dollars
It will pass to silence too.
"And here I am, wiping my butt with smooth pebbles."
Honestly i be seeing these overpriced condos and the prices i cant make sense of it a apt on steroids for 40 MILLION DOLLARS i honestly would buy my own island before i spent that on a condo
Even if i become billionaire i would never waste that ridiculous amount of money on thing called <b>luxurious life</b> <br>Imagine how many hospitals i can build for poor communities in that money.
"The views and that veranda alone justify the $39 million ask. In total, that quite possibly might be the best views in all of NYC. Stunning. Man, I wish I was a billionaire. Great job on the video."
Who cares had rather put money into a person and my view would be watching them take off.
"This apartment has such a dark vibe to it, also the &quot;kids&quot; part of the apartment looks more like prison bars for Jeffrey Epstein and alikes to keep their &quot;children&quot; confined there with a &quot;nice view&quot; :)"
"werid design, living area looks like hospital or mall lol"
"А теперь положа руку на сердце - кто ЗАХОТЕЛ? Не знаю что не так, может быть погода за окном, может быть ремонт делал очередной &quot;диэйнер&quot;... напоминает очень хорошее рабочее место в очень хорошей фирме. Но жить"
A C A Y I P. 👌 Design 👍 thanks Enes
Yeah nah the black and white wall paper is a deal breaker for me. Otherwise it might be suitable for me.
I wouldn’t feel safe in that building. If I can’t jump out the window with the maximum of a broken ankle or leg injury the building is too big
I can barely afford the phone i’m using to watch this 😂
If grocery stores become foodless what would be price of this penthouse ?
"Most people venture into crypto to be a millionaire, meanwhile, I just want to be debt free"
"Too much work getting to the ground floor, I like to walk into my garage, jump in my car and go."
This will be a great setting for a horror movie.
"<a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=idJthveed1M&amp;t=23m15s"">23:15</a> walking those stairs with see thru glass all over i would be frightened, these stairs do not look that strong , it is not for people that are afraid of heights ... seriously"
where barbeque?! ))))
I would&#39;ve loved to see the fire exit to this penthouse 😊
"Че по бабкам, американец?"
And yet no backyard. Skip.
"It’s weird to see daredevil doing real estate, especially showing off kingpins headquarters."
"I don’t like it. It’s cold. And at that price, I want CENTRAL PARK views."
"Sometimes, youtube pulls prank on commoners. <br>Youtube: 1<br>Me: 0"
So you have a great view of a horrible place to live.
Wonder how much for the electricity bill
Watching this as I decide which coupons to use for dinner
Bland and bold tasteless minimalism.
with 39 mil you can build a few mansions yourself lol
I would definitely not want to know the person who had the desire to live in a place like that. Has to be a f’ing narcissist
Too costly
Must be hard to be Rich
Is it just me but audio really low?
i&#39;d buy but it&#39;s too big for me to clean up all by myself and i can&#39;t afford a servant
"theres is nothing cozy about this place. it looks like a dungeon. cool views is about all it has going for it. the interior design, especially the zebra print is horrid. 👎🏼"
BLACKS WE ARE GOD CHOSEN PEOPLE THE REAL HEBREW ISRAELITES ISRAELITES OF THE BIBLE RESEARCH ...
Lots of glass to clean
Casimiro tem que fazer essa
Meh
"It&#39;s really cool, but law of diminishing returns applies to a huge degree. The striped walls are actually annoying. For 40 million, it should all be the opposite of annoying."
"I&#39;m on my last roll of toilet tissue, and don&#39;t get paid for another week"
I think I like the little desk in the walk-in closet the best.
I did like the views and the balcony.
"No disrespect to Monique for her designs, but I cannot say that this strikes me as a $40 Million dollar penthouse. It just seems too crammed, simple and nothing necessarily strikes out to me. Anyone else?"
i&#39;m boy now! hahahahahahahahaha
The smog of New York
"To many doors and very tide place for this tipe of money, only location count and nuthing alse. Stone, stone, cold place for soul.Tarible. I think in today days the best design for interior is russian designers and they will make this place much better."
Garb for 40 mil……
We&#39;re getting rich in DOGE GF
After I lost over a hundred thousand dollars in the stock market after Biden took office..... I have a pack of hotdogs in my fridge ...... and I did have 6 hard boiled eggs until I ate all 6 yesterday..... which is all I ate.
Not impressed for the price.
You pay all that money and it is impressive but when you walk out you&#39;re still in the concrete jungle
How much is HOA?
Bro HELLLLL no Im not paying 40M$ you can get a NICE ass mansion in Phoenix AZ for 1-5M$ and the same in Kingston NY. They were my choices when trying to relocate into one. Youre out of your mind. I better see some gold or diamond in that house for that price
Meh..all its takes is a shake and its all for nothing lol
I think we are over exaggerating the views.... i don&#39;t think i want to see buildings and cars all day just saying....
3 elevators🙏☝️🥲
Also don&#39;t forget to give a $1 to the bum sitting outside on sidewalk of your expensive penthouse.
I thought I was poor before watching this video. Now I&#39;m absolutely convinced.
I’d rather buy a house by the beach with a few acres around it.
Sell everything and give the money to the poor and follow me
No disrespect to you Enes. But anyone else look at this video in utter disgust for the vanity that caters to a system that creates a pent house like this...like what is the point? Yes this place looks good... but for every rich person that can afford this place there needs to be an increasing number of poor people. If thats the cost of being able to call a place like this home then I don&#39;t want it and I don&#39;t think anyone in their right mind would disagree
That is the ugliest fucking kitchen i have seen
I mean literally how many times he said &quot;I really like that&quot;🤔
